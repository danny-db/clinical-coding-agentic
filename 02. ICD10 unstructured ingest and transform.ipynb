    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to create a data pipeline that transforms unstructured documents into a vector index. By the end of this notebook, you will have a Databricks Vector Search index that an AI agent could use to power a retriever that queries information about unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook creates a data pipeline using the following steps:\n",
    "1. Download sample PDF files from the GitHub repository [Databricks demo dataset](https://github.com/databricks-demos/dbdemos-dataset/tree/main).\n",
    "1. Load documents into a Delta table.\n",
    "1. Parse documents into text strings.\n",
    "1. Chunk the text strings into smaller, more manageable pieces for retrieval.\n",
    "1. Use an embedding model to embed the chunks into vectors and store the results in a vector index.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about building and optimizing unstructured data pipelines, see Databricks documentation ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/generative-ai/tutorials/ai-cookbook/quality-data-pipeline-rag) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/generative-ai/tutorials/ai-cookbook/quality-data-pipeline-rag)).\n",

    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to build and refine your data pipeline's quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run this notebook to build a Vector Search index with default settings**\n",
    "    - Configure the data source and destination tables in the `1️⃣ 📂 Data source and destination configuration` cells\n",
    "    - Press `Run All` to create the vector index.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Note: While you can adjust the other settings and modify the parsing/chunking code, we suggest doing so only after evaluating your Agent's quality so you can make improvements that specifically address root causes of quality issues.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run other sample notebooks to create an AI agent retriever that queries the vector index, then evaluate the agent/retriever's quality.**\n",
    "   - See agent examples that include boilerplate code to integrate a vector search index ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/generative-ai/agent-framework/author-agent#chat-agent-examples) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/generative-ai/agent-framework/author-agent#chat-agent-examples)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If the evaluation results show retrieval issues as a root cause, use this notebook to iterate on your data pipeline code & configuration.** \n",
    "\n",
    "    - The following are potential fixes you can try, see Databricks documentation for debugging retrieval issues for more information ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/generative-ai/tutorials/ai-cookbook/implementation/step-5-debug-retrieval-quality) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/generative-ai/tutorials/ai-cookbook/implementation/step-5-debug-retrieval-quality)).\n",
    "      - Add missing, but relevant source documents into in the index.\n",
    "      - Resolve any conflicting information in source documents.\n",
    "      - Adjust the data pipeline configuration:\n",
    "        - Modify chunk size or overlap.\n",
    "        - Experiment with different embedding models.\n",
    "      - Adjust the data pipeline code:\n",
    "        - Create a custom parser or use different parsing libraries.\n",
    "        - Develop a custom chunker or use different chunking techniques.\n",
    "        - Extract additional metadata for each document.\n",
    "      - Adjust the Agent's code/config in subsequent notebooks:\n",
    "        - Change the number of documents retrieved (K).\n",
    "        - Try a re-ranker.\n",
    "        - Use hybrid search.\n",
    "        - Apply extracted metadata as filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook provides a foundation for creating unstructured data pipelines. For production workloads, Databricks recommends refactoring this notebook into separate components that can be orchestrated using [Databricks Workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/workflows). In production workloads, you would pull out the code definitions into modules and separate the steps into individual tasks to be orchestrated over one or more workflows."

    "### Serialization functions\n",
    "The goal of serialization is to save the class name (e.g., `util.xx.xx.configClassName`) with the dumped YAML.\n",
    "This allows ANY config to be dynamically loaded from a YAML without knowing about the `configClassName` before OR having it imported in your Python env.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is necessary for MultiAgent.`agents` and FunctionCallingAgent.`tools` since they can have multiple types of agent or tool configs in them -- when the config is loaded in the serving or local env, we don't know what these `configClassName` will be ahead of time & we want to avoid importing them all in the Python env.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works:\n",
    "The ONLY way to dump a class is to call `model_dump()` on it, which will return a dict with the `_CLASS_PATH_KEY` key containing the class path e.g., `util.xx.xx.configClassName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other dumping methods (yaml, etc) call model_dump() since it is a Pydantic method. The ONLY way to load a serialized class is to call `load_obj_from_yaml` with the YAML string.\n",
    "`load_obj_from_yaml` will parse the YAML string and get the class path key.\n",
    "It will then use that class path key to dynamically load the class from the Python path.\n",
    "It will then call that class's _load_class_from_dict method with the remaining data to let it do anything custom e.g,. load the tools or the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't overridden `_load_class_from_dict`, it will call the default implementation of this method from `SerializableModel`\n",
    "otherwise, it will call your overridden `_load_class_from_dict` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use:\n",
    "Inherit your config class from `SerializableModel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have any `SerializableModel` fields, you can call `load_obj_from_yaml` directly on your class's dumped YAML string; nothing else is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have SerializableModel fields, you must:\n",
    "1. Override the _load_class_from_dict method to handle the deserialization of those sub-configs\n",
    "2. Override the model_dump method to call the model_dump of each of those sub-configs properly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "1. No sub-configs: GenieAgentConfig, UCTool\n",
    "2. Has sub-configs: FunctionCallingAgentConfig (in `tools`), MultiAgentConfig (in `agents`)\n",
    "load_obj_from_yaml --> The only way a class is loaded will get the classpath key\n",
    "\n",
